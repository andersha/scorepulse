## Information Stored Locally

The App stores minimal, non-personal data **locally on your device only**. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any server.

### Storage Method:
- Data is stored using iOS's standard file system and UserDefaults
- Storage is sandboxed to the App and cannot be accessed by other apps
- Total storage varies based on imported scores (typically under 100KB)

### How to Delete:
You can delete all locally stored data by:
- Deleting individual scores using the swipe-to-delete gesture in the app
- Deleting and reinstalling the app
- Using iOS Settings → ScorePulse → Delete App Data
